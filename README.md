# 🎴 HY252 Lost Cities Project  

This repository contains an implementation of a board game mimic inspired by the classic Lost Cities board game, developed as part of the HY252 Java course (3rd semester) at CSD. The game is themed around ancient Greek cities and their corresponding relics.


> 🏆 **Awarded the highest possible grade** in the course.

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project was designed as an **educational exercise in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, focusing on core principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.  

While the UI may be a bit messy (because, honestly, UI development isn't my favorite), the game logic itself is well-structured and functional.  

## 📄 Documentation  
Unfortunately, the final documentation was lost. However, I've attached an **older, unfinished** version of the documentation with early-stage **UML diagrams** to provide some insight into the system design.

## ⚠️ Known Issues  
- The **last commit** improved code clarity and structure but **broke some functionality related to special cards**. I decided to keep this version since it’s cleaner and better for demonstration purposes.  
- UI could certainly use some polishing, but the focus was mainly on game logic and OOP principles.
- **Git commits are unprofessional**, with inconsistent messages and structure. This was due to it being a personal project


## 🚀 How to Run  
Currently, the project is **difficult to run** due to missing dependencies.  
The original JAR file was faulty and not included in the repository, which affects test functionality and some core features. 
There will possibly be an attempt to fix it later.
- The **`.iml` file is included**, which might help with importing the project in IntelliJ IDEA but could also cause issues depending on your environment.
